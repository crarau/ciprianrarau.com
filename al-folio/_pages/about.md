I am an entrepreneur and software engineer with a passion for leading the development and growth of innovative technology solutions. As the Co-Founder and CTO of WISK.ai, I spearheaded the creation of a next-level food and beverage platform for the hospitality sector. WISK.ai is a modular, secure, scalable, and resilient platform that caters to small, medium, and large enterprise customers, both offline and online.

I have a proven track record of building businesses from scratch.

- <a href="https://wisk.ai" target="_blank">WISK.ai</a> (Co-Founder/CTO/CPO) grew from 0 to 1,000 customers, bootstrapped then raised $3 million and became profitable. I was also an early investor.
- At OMsignal (CTO & 1st employee) (acquired by Honeywell), I helped raise $10 million.
- IdeaPlaces (Solo Founder), which integrated with Evernote, Dropbox, and Photos, creating pins on the map for these. The app achieved 25,000 downloads, had significant business traction, and was featured by Evernote in their ecosystem.
- Additionally, I have served as a fractional CTO for 5 venture-backed businesses.

Throughout my career, I have demonstrated my ability to transform initial ideas into successful, commercialized ventures. I have successfully raised multiple rounds of financing from seed to Series A and navigated complex challenges, including the Covid-19 pandemic. My hands-on leadership style has allowed me to contribute directly to key areas such as DevOps, backend, data architecture, data pipeline, data analytics, frontend, and mobile development.

I take pride in inspiring and motivating teams to achieve outstanding results by fostering a culture of trust, transparency, and continuous improvement. My core values of connection, kindness, gratitude, curiosity, courage, empowerment, honesty, and love drive my passion for innovation and my commitment to building successful companies.

After an enriching journey with WISK.ai, I am now ready to embark on my next adventure. I am eager to leverage my experience and skills to drive new projects and innovations, and I look forward to exploring opportunities that align with my vision and values.
