      <p>
        I'm an entrepreneur, systems thinker, and hands-on builder with over 25 years of experience across tech, product, and business. I've built companies from scratch, scaled platforms to millions in revenue, and delivered high-performance systems that keep growing.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I'm not just writing code—I'm deeply involved in every part of the business. From architecture to AI, product to marketing, hiring to strategy. I see the full picture, and I act on it.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        What drives me right now is the shift we're living through. AI isn't just speeding things up—it's unlocking entire areas of business that were previously unimaginable. I work with B2B, B2C, B2N, across industries like health, hospitality, and performance management.
