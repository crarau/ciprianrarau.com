Before we start building this out though, I want to do a little planning with you. I first want you to make a project plan for this. Inside @projectplan.md please build an in depth plan for the app. Have high level checkpoints for each major step and feature, then in each checkpoint have a broken down list of small tasks youâ€™ll need to do to complete that checkpoint. Also in this plan include instructions we will give to a marketing background agent, a Researcher agent that will research user needs, and a feature planning agent that will plan the roadmap for us. We will then review this plan together.
